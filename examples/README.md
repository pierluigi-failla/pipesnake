# Examples

This is just a brief summary of examples available as Jupyter Noteboks.

## Playing with Iris dataset

Basic example on how to use `pipesnake` with Iris dataset [example_00_playing_with_iris](example_00_playing_with_iris.ipynb).

## Persistance

Storing and loading `pipesnake` pipes [example_01_persistance](example_01_persistance.ipynb).

## Embedding `pipesnake` in `sklearn`

`pipesnake` pipes are fully embeddable in `sklearn` pipelines. [example_02_within_sklearn](example_02_within_sklearn.ipynb) 
shows how you can do that. This shows also to mix `SeriesPipe` and `ParallelPipe`.

## Preparing data for LSTM Networks

You can use `pipesnake` to prepare data for LSTM Networks... [example_03_preparing_for_LSTM](example_03_preparing_for_LSTM.ipynb)
